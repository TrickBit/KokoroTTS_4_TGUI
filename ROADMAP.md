# KokoroTTS_4_TGUI Development Roadmap

## Current Status - v1.0 Release (January 2025)

### Completed Features
- High-quality TTS integration with Kokoro-82M model
- Speed control (0.5x - 1.5x) with pitch preservation
- Server-side pitch shifting with librosa (experimental)
- Integrated audio player with play/pause controls
- Smart text processing (code block handling, markdown cleaning)
- Self-contained architecture (no scattered user directory files)
- YAML-based settings management with hot-reloading
- Automatic audio file cleanup system
- Configurable debug logging (off/errors/all)
- Clean UI with grouped controls and voice preview
- Optimized NLTK resource management
- British and American English voice support

### Architecture Highlights
- Server-side audio processing (no browser complexity)
- Button cloning system for integrated UI
- Settings save optimization (only on actual use)
- Module hot-reloading for development
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Planned Features - v2.0 and Beyond

### 1. Voice Blending System (High Priority)
**Inspiration**: [nazdridoy/kokoro-tts](https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts) voice blending implementation

**Complexity Assessment**: Medium (2-4 hours if adapting existing code)

**Features**:
- Weight-based voice mixing: `"af_sarah:60,am_adam:40"` (60-40 mix)
- Equal blending: `"am_adam,af_sarah"` (50-50 mix)
- UI integration with text input or dropdown selection
- Preserve existing single-voice system as default

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Study nazdridoy's voice blending algorithm
2. Extract weight parsing logic for blend syntax
3. Adapt voice loading code to support blended embeddings
4. Add "Voice Blend" input to UI
5. Maintain backward compatibility with single voices

**Technical Notes**:
- Uses pre-processed voice embeddings (voices-v1.0.bin format)
- Weight-based mixing at embedding level (not audio level)
- Clean API design with intuitive syntax

### 2. Multi-Language Support (Medium Priority)
**Target Languages**: French, Italian, Japanese, Chinese (based on available Kokoro voices)

**Implementation**:
- Language detection and voice filtering
- Localized UI elements
- Language-specific text processing rules
- Extended voice library management

### 3. Advanced Audio Features (Low Priority)
**Potential Features**:
- Audio format options (WAV/MP3)
- Bitrate/quality settings
- Advanced pitch algorithms (phase vocoder, PSOLA)
- Real-time audio effects

### 4. Enhanced Text Processing (Medium Priority)
**Features**:
- EPUB/PDF document processing
- Chapter-based audio splitting
- Advanced markdown handling
- Custom text preprocessing rules

### 5. Performance Optimizations (Ongoing)
**Areas**:
- GPU utilization improvements
- Faster audio generation pipeline
- Memory usage optimization
- Caching strategies for repeated content

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

### Code Cleanup Tasks
- Remove experimental pitch HTML generators (completed in v1.0)
- Consolidate redundant functions
- Improve error message consistency
- Add comprehensive unit tests

### Documentation Updates
- API documentation for developers
- User guide with examples
- Troubleshooting section expansion
- Video tutorials for complex features

## Research and Exploration

### Voice Technology
- Custom voice training possibilities
- Voice conversion techniques
- Emotional tone control
- Speaking style variations

### Integration Opportunities
- API endpoints for external tools
- Plugin system for custom processors
- Webhook support for automation
- Cloud deployment options

## Version Planning

### v1.1 (Minor Updates)
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- UI polish and user experience enhancements
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimizations

### v2.0 (Major Feature Release)
- Voice blending system
- Multi-language support foundation
- Enhanced text processing pipeline
- Architectural improvements

### v3.0 (Advanced Features)
- Custom voice training
- Real-time audio effects
- Cloud integration options
- Plugin ecosystem

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain ABDF philosophy ("Ain't Broke Don't Fix")
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear logging and debugging
- Self-contained architecture
- Backward compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for audio quality
- Automated tests for core functions
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing

### Release Process
- Git tagging for stable releases
- Comprehensive changelogs
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Community feedback integration

## Context for Future Development Sessions

### Key Design Decisions
- Server-side processing over browser-based solutions
- YAML configuration over database storage
- Self-contained extension over system-wide installation
- Quality over quantity in feature selection

### Successful Patterns
- Settings save optimization (only on use)
- Button cloning for UI integration
- Module hot-reloading for development
- Comprehensive logging system

### Lessons Learned
- Real-time browser audio processing has quality limitations
- User experience benefits from integrated rather than separate controls
- Clean architecture pays dividends in maintenance
- Performance optimization should balance quality and speed

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python with PyTorch/librosa for audio processing
- **Frontend**: Gradio with custom HTML/JavaScript components
- **Configuration**: YAML files with runtime object storage
- **Audio**: WAV format with 24kHz sample rate
- **Model**: Kokoro-82M from HuggingFace
